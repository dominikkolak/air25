North Report:22,"Its main findings were; 20th century instrumentally measured warming showed in observational evidence, and can be simulated with climate models, large-scale surface temperature reconstructions yield a generally consistent picture of temperature trends during the preceding millennium, including the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age, but the exact timing and duration of warm periods may have varied from region to region, and the magnitude and geographic extent of the warmth are uncertain.",North Report
Hockey stick controversy:183,"He wrote that this graph asserts that temperatures during the Medieval Warm Period were higher than those of today, and described climate changes as due to solar variation.",Hockey stick controversy
Medieval Warm Period:61,"Peak temperatures did not rise as high as those from the late 20th century, which were unprecedented in the area during the study period of 1600 years.",Medieval Warm Period
Medieval Warm Period:7,It was only in the 20th and 21st centuries that the Northern Hemisphere experienced higher temperatures.,Medieval Warm Period
Greenhouse gas:185,"These emissions include CO2 from fossil fuel use and from land use, as well as emissions of methane, nitrous oxide and other greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol.",Greenhouse gas
Greenhouse gas:232,"Overall, developed countries accounted for 83.8% of industrial CO2 emissions over this time period, and 67.8% of total CO2 emissions.",Greenhouse gas
Greenhouse gas:27,Oxidation of CO to CO2 directly produces an unambiguous increase in radiative forcing although the reason is subtle.,Greenhouse gas
Cloud:342,"Leading global models produce quite different results, however, with some showing increasing low clouds and others showing decreases.",Cloud

Sunlight:20,"If the extraterrestrial solar radiation is 1367 watts per square meter the value when the Earth-Sun distance is 1 astronomical unit, then the direct sunlight at Earths surface when the Sun is at the zenith is about 1050 W/m2, but the total amount direct and indirect from the atmosphere hitting the ground is around 1120 W/m2.",Sunlight
Sunlight:27,Dividing the irradiance of 1050 W/m2 by the size of the Suns disk in steradians gives an average radiance of 15.4 MW per square metre per steradian.,Sunlight
Sunlight:274,"100 watts per square meter 14,000 lux corresponds to daytime with overcast clouds Craig Bohren.",Sunlight
Sunlight:5,Other sources indicate an Average over the entire earth of 164 Watts per square meter over a 24 hour day.,Sunlight
Radiative forcing:20,"A typical value of λ, 0.8 K/W/m2, gives an increase in global temperature of about 1.6 K above the 1750 reference temperature due to the increase in CO2 over that time 278 to 405 ppm, for a forcing of 2.0 W/m2, and predicts a further warming of 1.4 K above present temperatures if the CO2 mixing ratio in the atmosphere were to become double its pre-industrial value; both of these calculations assume no other forcings.",Radiative forcing
Great Barrier Reef:135,The Queensland shark control program uses shark nets and drum lines with baited hooks to kill sharks in the Great Barrier Reef - there are 173 lethal drum lines in the Great Barrier Reef.,Great Barrier Reef
Great Barrier Reef:255,Seabirds will land on the platforms and defecate which will eventually be washed into the sea.,Great Barrier Reef
Great Barrier Reef:33,"When Queensland edged into tropical waters 24 million years ago, some coral grew, but a sedimentation regime quickly developed with erosion of the Great Dividing Range; creating river deltas, oozes and turbidites, unsuitable conditions for coral growth.",Great Barrier Reef
Great Barrier Reef:58,"Crescentic reefs are also found in the far north of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, and in the Swain Reefs 20-22 degrees south.",Great Barrier Reef
Climate variability:103,"Given that records of solar activity are accurate, solar activity may have contributed to part of the modern warming that peaked in the 1930s, in addition to the 60-year temperature cycles that result in roughly 0.5 °C of warming during the increasing temperature phase.",Climate variability
Meteorology:4,"It was not until after the elucidation of the laws of physics and more particularly, the development of the computer, allowing for the automated solution of a great many equations that model the weather, in the latter half of the 20th century that significant breakthroughs in weather forecasting were achieved.",Meteorology
Physics:112,The problems in this field start with a mathematical model of a physical situation system and a mathematical description of a physical law that will be applied to that system.,Physics
Theoretical physics:17,"Modelers also called model-builders often appear much like phenomenologists, but try to model speculative theories that have certain desirable features rather than on experimental data, or apply the techniques of mathematical modeling to physics problems.",Theoretical physics
Theoretical physics:22,"Theoretical advances may consist in setting aside old, incorrect paradigms e.g., aether theory of light propagation, caloric theory of heat, burning consisting of evolving phlogiston, or astronomical bodies revolving around the Earth or may be an alternative model that provides answers that are more accurate or that can be more widely applied.",Theoretical physics
Attribution of recent climate change:212,"According to Wilson, Wobbles in the orbit of Mars are the main cause of its climate change in the current era see also orbital forcing.",Attribution of recent climate change
Attribution of recent climate change:5,"Some of the main human activities that contribute to global warming are: increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, for a warming effect global changes to land surface, such as deforestation, for a warming effect increasing atmospheric concentrations of aerosols, mainly for a cooling effect In addition to human activities, some natural mechanisms can also cause climate change, including for example, climate oscillations, changes in solar activity, and volcanic activity.",Attribution of recent climate change
Attribution of recent climate change:529,The main cause of climate change during the last millennia is the corresponding cyclic variation of the 80- and 200-year component of irradiance correlated with activity.,Attribution of recent climate change
Earth:161,"Sea water has an important influence on the worlds climate, with the oceans acting as a large heat reservoir.",Earth
Tropical cyclone:94,"From hydrostatic balance, the warm core translates to lower pressure at the center at all altitudes, with the maximum pressure drop located at the surface.",Tropical cyclone
Volcano:114,"Usually, only mafic flows will erupt as pāhoehoe, since they often erupt at higher temperatures or have the proper chemical make-up to allow them to flow with greater fluidity.",Volcano
